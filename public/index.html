<h1><img src="nodefu.gif"><br/>Opensource Node.js Hosting Services!</h1>
<p>NodeFu is offering free experimental Node.js hosting services via our RESTful API running on Amazon EC2.  We are currently running Node v.0.3.3 and updating all of the NPM modules on a weekly basis. Git is also required to push your updates to Nodefu.  We do not currently have a full featured website as we are focusing on the API and the service.  All we ask is that you be a good steward of this service and community.  In other words, please don't try to hack our service and please reuse your port assignments when possible.</p>
